## Teacher Setup Instructions

For this scheme of work students will need access to:

- A Raspberry Pi
- A keyboard and mouse connected to the RPi
- A monitor connected to the RPi
- Latest NOOBS SD card with Raspbian installed (instructions below)
- espeak downloaded and installed on each SD card (instructions below)

For lesson 3 students will need this additional equipment:

- A headphone splitter connected to the RPi audio jack, if students are working in pairs on one RPi.
- A pair of headphones connected to the splitter or RPi per student.


### Downloading and installing NOOBS

Instructions for best practice on [downloading and installing NOOBS can be read here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/blob/master/installation/noobs.md).

### Making a class set of SD cards

Once you have completed the steps above, you can make a copy of your master SD card and then use that to make a class set.

1. Place your master SD card in a computer or laptop with an SD card reader. 
2. On Microsoft Windows use [Win32 Disk Imager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) to make a copy of an SD card. On Mac OS X, you can use the `dd` command or a [dd GUI](http://www.gingerbeardman.com/dd-gui/).
3. Remove the master SD card and keep it safe.
4. Take a fresh SD card and insert it into your computer or laptop. 
5. Format the SD card then, using your imaging software, select the image and write it to the card.
6. Repeat the last step for the rest of your cards.
